  <h1> <strong> A Day in the Life of Mollie! </strong> </h1>

  <h4> <div> <p>  Hi, my name is Mollie! I am almost 5 years old. I was adopted by Sammy’s
		family from a shelter when I was 6 months old. I’m mixed breed, and no one
		really knows what breeds I am. The vet thinks I’m part Manchester Terrier,
		 part Australian Shepherd, and a bunch of other breeds, too.</p>

  <p>  I usually wake up around 7 am and then go into the family room where I sleep for
		a little more and occasionally look out the window for squirrels. </p>

  <p>  Then, I go for a walk where I try to see more squirrels or some bunnies that
		live in my neighborhood. Sometimes I also see my friends such as Maya, Ted, or Ferris.
		 When I get back from my walk, I play with my toys and eat breakfast! </p>

<br>
	<p>  Then, I usually play some more, follow my mom around the house, or sleep. Around
		lunch, I go for another walk and eat some treats! Then, I take a nap again. When Sammy
		and her sister Sydney come home from school, I usually sit with them while they do
		 homework or rest some more. I go for another walk, and then I eat dinner! </p>

<br>
	<p>  While my family eats their dinner, I usually bark to try to get some treats
		or try to jump up and steal food or napkins from the table. After that, I play
		outside and go for another walk with my family. By that time, it’s usually 8:30 pm,
		and I either play a little more inside or rest around the house. Finally, at around 10 pm,
		I go to sleep after a long day of eating, sleeping, and playing. </p>
